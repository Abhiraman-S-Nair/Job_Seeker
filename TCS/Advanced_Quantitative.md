# Top 15 Questions

This section focuses on complex mathematical and logical problem-solving skills. Below are important topics along with 15 questions and detailed solutions.

### 1. Probability
**Question 1:** What is the probability of getting a sum of 7 when two dice are rolled?
- **Solution:** There are 6×6=36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. The pairs that give a sum of 7 are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1), i.e., 6 outcomes.
- **Answer:** \( P = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \)
- **Method:** Count favorable outcomes and divide by total outcomes.

**Question 2:** A bag contains 4 red, 5 blue, and 3 green balls. If a ball is picked at random, what is the probability it is red or blue?
- **Solution:** Total balls = 4+5+3 = 12. Red or blue balls = 4+5 = 9.
- **Answer:** \( P = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \)
- **Method:** Add the favorable outcomes for red and blue, divide by total outcomes.

## 2. Permutations and Combinations
**Question 3:** How many ways can 5 people be seated in a row?
- **Solution:** The number of ways to arrange 5 people = \( 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120 \)
- **Answer:** 120
- **Method:** Use the formula for permutations \( n! \) for arranging items in a row.

**Question 4:** From a group of 7 men and 6 women, how many ways can 4 men and 3 women be selected?
- **Solution:** \( \binom{7}{4} \times \binom{6}{3} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} \times \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = 35 \times 20 = 700 \)
- **Answer:** 700
- **Method:** Use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \).

## 3. Mensuration
**Question 5:** What is the surface area of a sphere with radius 7 cm?
- **Solution:** Surface area of a sphere = \( 4\pi r^2 \). Substituting \( r = 7 \),
- **Answer:** \( 4\pi(7^2) = 4\pi(49) = 616 \text{ cm}^2 \)
- **Method:** Apply the surface area formula for a sphere.

**Question 6:** A rectangle has a length of 15 m and a width of 10 m. What is the area?
- **Solution:** Area of rectangle = length × width.
- **Answer:** \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ m}^2 \)
- **Method:** Simple multiplication using the rectangle area formula.

## 4. Algebra
**Question 7:** Solve for x: \( 2x + 3 = 15 \)
- **Solution:** Subtract 3 from both sides: \( 2x = 12 \), then divide by 2: \( x = 6 \)
- **Answer:** x = 6
- **Method:** Basic algebraic manipulation.

**Question 8:** Find the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).
- **Solution:** Factor the equation: \( (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \). So, \( x = 2 \) or \( x = 3 \)
- **Answer:** x = 2, x = 3
- **Method:** Factorization.

## 5. Puzzles
**Question 9:** If 5 monkeys can eat 5 bananas in 5 minutes, how many minutes will it take for 10 monkeys to eat 10 bananas?
- **Solution:** Each monkey eats 1 banana in 5 minutes. So, 10 monkeys will still take 5 minutes to eat 10 bananas.
- **Answer:** 5 minutes
- **Method:** Understand the rate remains the same.

**Question 10:** A clock shows 3:15. What is the angle between the hour and the minute hand?
- **Solution:** Hour hand moves 0.5° per minute, so at 3:15, it has moved 7.5° from the 3-hour mark. Minute hand is at 90°. Angle = 90° - 7.5° = 82.5°
- **Answer:** 82.5°
- **Method:** Calculate the positions of the hands based on time.

## 6. Probability (Advanced)
**Question 11:** Two cards are drawn from a deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that both are aces?
- **Solution:** \( P = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{1}{221} \)
- **Answer:** \( \frac{1}{221} \)
- **Method:** Use probability without replacement.

## 7. Time, Speed, and Distance
**Question 12:** A car travels 120 km in 2 hours. What is its speed?
- **Solution:** Speed = Distance / Time.
- **Answer:** \( 120 / 2 = 60 \text{ km/h} \)
- **Method:** Basic speed formula.

**Question 13:** If a train 150 m long passes a pole in 15 seconds, what is the speed of the train in km/h?
- **Solution:** Speed = \( \frac{Distance}{Time} = \frac{150}{15} = 10 \text{ m/s} \). Convert to km/h: \( 10 \times 3.6 = 36 \text{ km/h} \)
- **Answer:** 36 km/h
- **Method:** Convert m/s to km/h by multiplying by 3.6.

## 8. Simple and Compound Interest
**Question 14:** Find the simple interest on Rs. 5000 at 5% per annum for 2 years.
- **Solution:** Simple Interest = \( \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \), where P = 5000, R = 5%, T = 2 years.
- **Answer:** \( \frac{5000 \times 5 \times 2}{100} = 500 \)
- **Method:** Use the simple interest formula.

**Question 15:** Calculate the compound interest on Rs. 8000 for 2 years at 5% per annum compounded annually.
- **Solution:** Compound Interest = \( P(1 + \frac{R}{100})^T - P \), where P = 8000, R = 5%, T = 2 years.
- **Answer:** \( 8000(1 + \frac{5}{100})^2 - 8000 = 8000(1.1025) - 8000 = 820 \)
- **Method:** Apply the compound interest formula.
