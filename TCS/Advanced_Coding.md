# Advanced Coding
Advanced coding tests your problem-solving skills through writing algorithms and optimizing solutions.

## Top 5 Topics
1. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
2. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting, searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Quick Sort)
3. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Solving problems by breaking them into subproblems
4. **Recursion**
   - Writing recursive functions for problems
5. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Understanding and applying OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
