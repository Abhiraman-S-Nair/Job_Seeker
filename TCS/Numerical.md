## 15 Practice Questions with Answers and Explanations

### 1. Number System
**Q1:** What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 18?

**Answer:** 36  
**Method:** Find the prime factors of both numbers:
- 12 = 2^2 × 3
- 18 = 2 × 3^2  
The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes = 2^2 × 3^2 = 36.

---

**Q2:** What is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 42?

**Answer:** 14  
**Method:** Find the prime factors of both numbers:
- 28 = 2^2 × 7
- 42 = 2 × 3 × 7  
The GCD is the product of the smallest powers of all common primes = 2 × 7 = 14.

---

**Q3:** Divide 372 by 12.

**Answer:** 31  
**Method:** Perform basic division:  
372 ÷ 12 = 31.

---

### 2. Percentages
**Q4:** A shopkeeper buys an item for ₹500 and sells it for ₹600. What is the percentage profit?

**Answer:** 20%  
**Method:**  
Profit = Selling price - Cost price = ₹600 - ₹500 = ₹100  
Profit percentage = (Profit/Cost price) × 100 = (100/500) × 100 = 20%.

---

**Q5:** A student scored 45 out of 60 marks. What is the percentage score?

**Answer:** 75%  
**Method:**  
Percentage = (Marks scored/Total marks) × 100 = (45/60) × 100 = 75%.

---

**Q6:** If a number is increased by 20%, what will be its final value if the original number is 150?

**Answer:** 180  
**Method:**  
Increase = (20/100) × 150 = 30  
Final value = 150 + 30 = 180.

---

### 3. Time, Speed, and Distance
**Q7:** A car travels 120 km in 3 hours. What is its average speed?

**Answer:** 40 km/h  
**Method:**  
Speed = Distance/Time = 120 km ÷ 3 hours = 40 km/h.

---

**Q8:** Two trains are moving in opposite directions at 60 km/h and 90 km/h, respectively. What is their relative speed?

**Answer:** 150 km/h  
**Method:**  
Relative speed = Speed of train 1 + Speed of train 2 = 60 km/h + 90 km/h = 150 km/h.

---

**Q9:** If a cyclist covers 60 km in 4 hours, how much time will it take to cover 90 km at the same speed?

**Answer:** 6 hours  
**Method:**  
Speed = Distance/Time = 60 km ÷ 4 hours = 15 km/h  
Time to cover 90 km = 90 ÷ 15 = 6 hours.

---

### 4. Simple and Compound Interest
**Q10:** Calculate the simple interest for a principal of ₹1000 at a rate of 5% per annum for 3 years.

**Answer:** ₹150  
**Method:**  
Simple interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) ÷ 100  
= (1000 × 5 × 3) ÷ 100 = ₹150.

---

**Q11:** What is the compound interest on ₹2000 at 10% per annum for 2 years, compounded annually?

**Answer:** ₹420  
**Method:**  
Compound interest = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) - P  
= 2000(1 + 0.1)^2 - 2000 = ₹420.

---

**Q12:** A sum doubles in 8 years at simple interest. What is the rate of interest?

**Answer:** 12.5%  
**Method:**  
Using the formula for simple interest:  
Rate = (100 × Interest) ÷ (Principal × Time)  
Interest = Principal (since it doubles) = 100%  
Rate = (100 × 100) ÷ (100 × 8) = 12.5%.

---

### 5. Data Interpretation
**Q13:** In a pie chart, 30% of the total votes were given to candidate A. If there are 600 total votes, how many votes did candidate A get?

**Answer:** 180 votes  
**Method:**  
Number of votes for A = 30% of 600 = (30/100) × 600 = 180.

---

**Q14:** The average of five numbers is 60. If four of the numbers are 55, 65, 70, and 50, what is the fifth number?

**Answer:** 60  
**Method:**  
Total of five numbers = Average × Number of numbers = 60 × 5 = 300  
Sum of four numbers = 55 + 65 + 70 + 50 = 240  
Fifth number = Total - Sum of four numbers = 300 - 240 = 60.

---

**Q15:** A table shows the sales of a product over five months: Jan (₹5000), Feb (₹4000), Mar (₹6000), Apr (₹4500), May (₹7000). What is the average monthly sale?

**Answer:** ₹5300  
**Method:**  
Sum of sales = ₹5000 + ₹4000 + ₹6000 + ₹4500 + ₹7000 = ₹26500  
Average = ₹26500 ÷ 5 = ₹5300.
